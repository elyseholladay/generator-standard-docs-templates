# generator-standard-docs-templates

> A generator that creates standard templates for common repository documentation.

To make it easy for engineers on your team to do the right thing and write great documentation, this package generates standard documentation templates. Using a Yeoman generator CLI, you can answer questions to get a pre-filled README. 

*   **README** â€” As the entry point to the tool, a good README should explain what the tool is, how to use and install it, and how to get in touch with maintainers. A standard README template makes it easy for consumers to find the information they need.
