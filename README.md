# generator-standard-docs-templates

> A generator that creates standard templates for common repository documentation.

To make it easy for engineers on your team to do the right thing and write great documentation, this package generates standard documentation templates. Using a Yeoman generator CLI, you can answer questions to get a pre-filled README and other documentation.

*   **README** — As the entry point to the tool, a good README should explain what the tool is, how to use and install it, and how to get in touch with maintainers. A standard README template makes it easy for consumers to find the information they need.
*   **CONTRIBUTING** — Contributing information helps turn consumers into collaborators, by describing how to install, contribute, code review, and participate in the tool's development.
*   **CHANGELOG** — A changelog, both automatically generated and human-augmented, helps consumers understand the changes between versions. A changelog is a crucial part of understanding how to upgrade.
*   **CODE_OF_CONDUCT** — Based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), a code of conduct governs how we interact with contributors to our projects.
*   **LICENSE** — Optional, but useful if you want your project to be shared and used. A license is required for many organizations to use OS projects.
