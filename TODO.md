# TODO

* add list of files the generator creates
* update with instructions for `npx`.
* can we check to see if the tool name matches the repo name, and fail if it doesn't? Do we _want_ to do that?

## Coming Soon

*   **CONTRIBUTING** — Contributing information helps turn consumers into collaborators, by describing how to install, contribute, code review, and participate in the tool's development.
*   **CHANGELOG** — A changelog, both automatically generated and human-augmented, helps consumers understand the changes between versions. A changelog is a crucial part of understanding how to upgrade.
*   **CODE_OF_CONDUCT** — Based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), a code of conduct governs how we interact with contributors to our projects.
*   **LICENSE** — Optional, but useful if you want your project to be shared and used. A license is required for many organizations to use OS projects.
